    The object of the blackjack game is to accumulate cards
    with point totals as close to 21 without going over 21.
    Face cards (Jacks, Queens and Kings) are worth 10 points.
    Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever is preferable. Other
    blackjack cards are represented by their number. If a
    blackjack player and the House tie, it is a push and no
    one wins. Blackjack Ace and 10 (Blackjack) on the first
    two blackjack cards dealt is an automatic blackjack
    player win at 1.5 to 1, unless the house ties. A
    blackjack player may stand at any time. Playing blackjack:
    To win you need to beat the dealer without busting. You
    bust when your blackjack cards total to more than 21 and
    you lose automatically. The winner is whoever has closest
    to a total of 21. You reach 21 by adding up the values of
    the blackjack cards. The blackjack table seats about 6
    players. Either six or eight decks of blackjack cards are
    used and are shuffled together by the blackjack dealer
    and placed in a card dispensing box called 'Shoe'. Before
    receiving any blackjack cards players must place a wager.
    Then the players are dealt two cards face up. The
    blackjack dealer gets one face up, one face down. Each
    blackjack player in turn either stays or takes more
    blackjack cards to try and get closer to 21 without
    busting. Blackjack Players who do not bust wait for the
    dealer's turn. When all the players are done, the dealer
    turns up the down card. By blackjack rule, on counts of
    17 or higher the dealer must stay; on counts of 16 or
    lower the blackjack dealer must draw.</strong></font></p>
    <p><font color="#18013F" size="1" face="Verdana"><strong>If
    you make a total of 21 with the first two cards (a 10 or
    a face and an Ace), you win automatically. This is called
    'Blackjack'. If you have Blackjack, you will win one and
    one-half times your bet unless the dealer also has
    Blackjack, in which case it is a Push or a Tie (or a
    Stand-off) and you get your bet back. The remaining
    blackjack players with a higher count than the blackjack
    dealer win an amount equal to their bet. Blackjack
    Players with a lower count than the dealer lose their bet.
    If the dealer busts, all the remaining players win. There
    are other betting options namely Insurance, Surrender,
    Double Down, Even Money and Split. </strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#18013F" size="1"
    face="Verdana"><strong>Insurance: side bet up to half the
    initial bet against the blackjack dealer having a natural
    21 - allowed only when the dealer's showing card is an
    Ace. If the dealer has a 10 face down and makes a
    blackjack, insurance pays at 2-1 odds, but loses if the
    dealer does not. </strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#18013F" size="1"
    face="Verdana"><strong>Surrender: giving up your hand and
    lose only half the bet. </strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#18013F" size="1"
    face="Verdana"><strong>Early Surrender: surrender allowed
    before the blackjack dealer checks for blackjack. </strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#18013F" size="1"
    face="Verdana"><strong>Late Surrender: the blackjack
    dealer first checks to see if he has blackjack. If he
    does, surrender is not permitted. </strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#18013F" size="1"
    face="Verdana"><strong>Double Down: double your initial
    bet following the initial two-card deal, but you can hit
    one blackjack card only. A good bet if the blackjack
    player is in a strong situation. </strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#18013F" size="1"
    face="Verdana"><strong>Even Money: cashing in your
    blackjack bet immediately at a 1:1 payout ratio when you
    are dealt a natural blackjack and the blackjack dealer's
    showing card is a blackjack Ace. </strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#18013F" size="1"
    face="Verdana"><strong>Split Hand: split the initial two-card
    hand into two and play them separately - allowed only
    when the two first blackjack cards are of equal value.
    Use each blackjack card as the start to a separate hand
    and place a second bet equal to the first. </strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#18013F" size="1"
    face="Verdana"><strong>Hard Hand: A hand without a
    blackjack Ace, or with an Ace valued at 1 is said to be
    Hard in that it can only be given one value, unlike a
    Soft Hand. (You can value an Ace 1 or 11 to suit you).</strong></font></p>
